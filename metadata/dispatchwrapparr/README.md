## 🚀 Installation

Dispatchwrapparr can be installed through the official Dispatcharr plugin repository.

You can find this in Dispatcharr under 'Plugins' -> 'Find Plugins' and searching for 'Dispatchwrapparr'.

Once the Dispatchwrapparr plugin is installed, configuring your first profile is easy!

<img width="383" height="182" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f67e12ea-e03d-4ca2-aed3-b4b6ffe28b3e" />

Simply click 'Settings', complete the details in the form and then click 'Save'. When finished, click the 'Actions' tab and then click the 'Generate Stream Profile' button.

Note: For the new stream profile to appear, you will need to refresh Dispatcharr from your browser.

Dispatchwrapparr has many more features than those available in the form. The below documentation contains an exhaustive list of the capabilities of the plugin including how to achieve DRM decryption of HLS and DASH streams using clearkey(s).

Loading of the Dispatchwrapparr plugin creates two directories inside your /config directory, and installs the following files automatically:

- `/config/dispatchwrapparr/dispatchwrapparr.py`
- `/config/dispatchwrapparr/drmplugins/dashdrm.py`
- `/config/dispatchwrapparr/drmplugins/hlsdrm.py`

Updates to Dispatchwrapparr, including the files above are handled via the official Dispatcharr plugin system.

## 🛞 URL Fragment Options

URL fragment options can be used to tell Dispatchwrapparr what to do with a specific stream.

***Important: When using URL fragment options, it is recommended that you remove "URL" from the "M3U Hash Key" option in Dispatcharr. This setting can be found in 'Settings' > 'Stream Settings'.***

Below is a list of fragment options and their specifc usage:

| Fragment        | Type          | Example Usage                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :---            | :---          | :---                                         | :---                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| referer         | String        | `#referer=https://somesite.com/`             | Defines the 'Referer' header to use for the stream URL                                                                                                                                       | 
| origin          | String        | `#origin=https://somesite.com/`              | Defines the 'Origin' header to use for the stream URL                                                                                                                                        | 
| stream          | String        | `#stream=1080p_alt`                          | Override Dispatchwrapparr automatic stream selection with a manual selection for the stream URL                                                                                              | 
| novariantcheck  | Bool          | `#novariantcheck=true`                       | Do not automatically detect audio-only or video-only streams and mux in blank video or silent audio for compatibility purposes. Just pass through the stream as-is (without video or audio). |
| ffmpeg_nocopyts | Bool          | `#ffmpeg_nocopyts=true`                      | Do not copy timestamps during stream muxing. May help solve playability issues with some streams.                                                                                            |
| noaudio         | Bool          | `#noaudio=true`                              | Disables variant checking (-novariantcheck) and manually specifies that the stream contains no audio. This instructs Dispatchwrapparr to mux in silent audio.                                |
| novideo         | Bool          | `#novideo=true`                              | Disables variant checking (-novariantcheck) and manually specifies that the stream contains no video. This instructs Dispatchwrapparr to mux in blank video.                                 |

Important notes about fragment options:

- Fragments can be added to stream URL's inside m3u8 playlists, or added to stream URL's that are manually added as channels into Dispatcharr.
- Fragments are never passed to the origin. They are stripped off the URL before the actual stream is requested.
- Fragments will override any identical options specified by CLI arguments (Eg. `-clearkeys` / `#clearkey` or `-stream` / `#stream` ).
- `header` fragments can be repeated. If the same header appears more than once, the last value wins.
- Multiple fragments can be used, and can be separated by ampersand. (Eg. `https://stream.url/stream.manifest#clearkey=7ff8541ab5771900c442f0ba5885745f&referer=https://somesite.com/&stream=1080p_alt`).

### 🧑‍💻 Using the 'clearkey' URL fragment for DRM decryption

Most DRM implementations apply consistent encryption across both audio and video streams by using the same key.

In this instance, you can simply just supply a clearkey. The HLSDRM and DASHDRM plugins will ignore any Key ID (KID) supplied to it.

To use a single clearkey for a particular stream using a URL fragment, simply create a custom m3u8 file that places the #clearkey=<clearkey> fragment at the end of the stream URL.

Below is an example that could be used for Channel 4 (UK):

```channel-4-uk.m3u8
#EXTM3U
#EXTINF:-1 group-title="United Kingdom" channel-id="Channel4London.uk" tvg-id="Channel4London.uk" tvg-logo="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tv-logo/tv-logos/main/countries/united-kingdom/channel-4-uk.png", Channel 4
https://olsp.live.dash.c4assets.com/dash_iso_sp_tl/live/channel(c4)/manifest.mpd#clearkey=5ce85f1aa5771900b952f0ba58857d7a
```

More channels can be added to the same m3u8 file, and may also contain a mixture of DRM and non-DRM encrypted streams.

Simply upload your m3u8 file into Dispatcharr, select a Dispatchwrapparr stream profile, and it'll do the rest.

You can also add a cleakey fragment to the end of a URL of a stream being manually entered into Dispatcharr rather than administering a custom m3u8 file. This can be useful in testing.

For more complex streams that contain different clearkeys for video and audio, two keys can be provided in the order of 'video,audio'.

Streams which contain separate audio and video feeds, where only one is encrypted can specify 'none' as the key at the position.

The below table provides real world examples of how the DASHDRM and HLSDRM streamlink plugins process clearkeys.

| #clearkey=none,b1b1b1b1b1b1b1b1b1b1b1b1b1b1b1b1                                                         | None (Unencrypted)               | b1b1b1b1b1b1b1b1b1b1b1b1b1b1b1b1 |

### ▶️ Using the 'stream' URL fragment for manual stream variant/quality selection

The `#stream` fragment allows you to manually select a stream variant. Sometimes there may be occasions where you may want to manually select various stream variants depending on your preferences.

To find a list of available variants for a particular stream, simply run the following on the system running the dispatcharr docker container:

`docker logs dispatcharr -f --since 0m | grep 'Available streams'`

Once this command is running, play the stream and look at the output of the above command. It should show you a list of what variants are available.

Some examples of outputs are shown below:

`[dispatchwrapparr] 2025-10-14 19:44:01,860 [info] Available streams: 270p_alt, 270p, 360p_alt, 360p, 480p_alt, 480p, 720p_alt2, 720p_alt, 720p, 1080p_alt, 1080p, worst, best`

Once you have the stream you wish to use, eg. '1080p_alt', then all you need to do is append the fragment to the end of the stream URL as follows: `https://some.stream.com/playlist.m3u8#stream=1080p_alt`

In instances where a stream variants contain special characters such as '+' like in the second example above, you will need to ensure that the URL is encoded correctly. The '+' character is '%2B'.

For example, to select the '720p+a128k_48k' stream variant, then it would look like this: `https://some.stream.com/playlist.m3u8#stream=720p%2Ba128k_48k`

| -loglevel               | Optional | `CRITICAL`, `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `NOTSET` | Sets the python and ffmpeg log levels. By default, the loglevel is set to 'INFO'                                                                                                             |

Example: `dispatchwrapparr.py -i {streamUrl} -ua {userAgent} -proxy http://your.proxy.server:3128 -proxybypass 192.168.0.55,.somesite.com -clearkeys clearkeys.json -loglevel INFO`

### 💡 Using the -clearkeys CLI argument for DRM decryption

The -clearkeys CLI argument is perfect for building custom API's or supplying json files that contain or supply automatically rotated URL -> Clearkey pairs to Dispatchwrapparr for DRM decryption.

Below is an example of what Dispatchwrapparr expects in the json API response or file contents:

```clearkeys.json
{
  "https://olsp.live.dash.c4assets.com/dash_iso_sp_tl/live/channel(c4)/manifest.mpd": "5ce85f1aa5771900b952f0ba58857d7a",
  "https://some.other.stream.com/somechannel/*.mpd": "7ff8541ab5771900c442f0ba5885745f"
}
```

For streams where the video and audio use different clearkeys, place them in a comma separated list. Eg:

```clearkeys.json
{
  "https://olsp.live.dash.c4assets.com/dash_iso_sp_tl/live/channel(c4)/manifest.mpd": "5ce85f1aa5771900b952f0ba58857d7a,7ff8541ab5771900c442f0ba5885745f",
  "https://some.other.stream.com/somechannel/*.mpd": "7ff8541ab5771900c442f0ba5885745f"
}
```

- A json file can be specified by just the filename (Eg. `-clearkeys clearkeys.json`) where it will use the file 'clearkeys.json' within the same directory as dispatchwrapparr.py (Usually /data/dispatchwrapparr), or an absolute path to a json file (Eg. `-clearkeys /path/to/clearkeys.json`)
- A json HTTP API can be specified by providing the URL to the -clearkeys argument (Eg. `-clearkeys https://someserver.local/clearkeys?getkeys`)
- When using the `-proxy` directive, be careful to ensure that you add your clearkeys api endpoints into the `-proxybypass` list if the endpoints are local to your network
- Wildcards/Globs (*) are supported by Dispatchwrapparr for URL -> Clearkey matching. (Eg. The URL string could look like this and still match a Clearkey `https://olsp.live.dash.c4assets.com/*/live/channel(c4)/*.mpd`)
- Supports KID:KEY combinations, and comma delimited lists of clearkeys where multiple keys are required, although only the Clearkey is needed.
- If `-clearkeys` is specified, and no stream URL matches a clearkey, Dispatchwrapparr will simply carry on as normal and treat the stream as if it's not DRM encrypted

## 😊 Streamlink Plugins

You do not need to use Dispatchwrapparr in order to use the DASH and HLS DRM plugins. If you wish, you can use the `dashdrm.py` and `hlsdrm.py` plugins on their own with Streamlink.

Credit to [titus-au](https://github.com/titus-au/streamlink-plugin-dashdrm) whose work with DASH DRM and streamlink provided the basis by which the Dispatchwrapparr plugins are created.

## ‼️ Troubleshooting

### Jellyfin IPTV streaming issues

In Jellyfin there are a number of settings related to m3u8 manifests.

Make sure that all options ("Allow fMP4 transcoding container", "Allow stream sharing", "Auto-loop live streams", "Ignore DTS (decoding timestamp)", and "Read input at native frame rate") are unticked/disabled.

### My streams stop on ad breaks, why?

This is a technology called SCTE-35 (aka. SSAI or DAI) which injects ads/commercial breaks into streams based on parameters such as geolocation and demographics etc.

While dispatchwrapparr has had some success in dealing with these types of streams, due to the way that some broadcasters implement SCTE-35 it may not always be stable.

### Can I use a custom Streamlink plugin? (ie. one not included in Streamlink by default)

Yes, maybe, but it depends on if you need to pass any custom arguments to it. Pass the `-streamlink_plugins` option to Dispatchwrapparr, specifying a custom directory to look for plugins in. In some circumstances, plugins may require Chromium based browsers for session tokens, and/or require additional arguments which Dispatchwrapparr will not pass through. The best option here is to just use Streamlink directly.
